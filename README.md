Rental Management System with Real-Time Chat
This project is a Rental Management System integrated with a Real-Time Chat feature designed to streamline communication between landlords and tenants (or interested renters).

Project Objectives:
For Landlords (Admin):
The system helps landlords manage their rental properties and communicate directly with tenants or prospective renters. It also allows landlords to accommodate viewing requests by showcasing available rooms online, making it easier for renters to explore options before scheduling an in-person visit.

For Tenants / Interested Renters:
The platform enables tenants and prospective renters to connect with landlords instantly through a real-time messaging system. This removes the hassle of physically visiting each property and simplifies the decision-making process by allowing users to inquire, compare, and discuss rental details directly from the platform.

Key Features:
Real-time chat between tenant and landlord

Online room/property listing with details and images

Easy scheduling or inquiry for room viewings

Admin panel for managing properties and tenant interactions
